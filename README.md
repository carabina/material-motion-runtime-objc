# Material Motion Runtime for Apple Devices

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/material-motion/material-motion-runtime-objc.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/material-motion/material-motion-runtime-objc)

The Material Motion Runtime is a tool for describing motion declaratively.

## Declarative motion, aka motion as data

This library does not do much on its own. What it does do, however, is enable the expression of
motion as data.

This library encourages you to describe motion as data, or what we call *plans*. Plans are committed
to a *scheduler*. The scheduler then coordinates the creation of *performers*, objects responsible
for translating plans into concrete execution.

## Installation

### Installation with CocoaPods

Add `MaterialMotionRuntime` to your `Podfile`:

    pod 'MaterialMotionRuntime'

Then run the following command:

    pod install

## Example apps/unit tests

To check out a local copy of the repo and run our example apps you can run the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-runtime-objc.git
    cd material-motion-runtime-objc
    pod install
    open MaterialMotionRuntime.xcworkspace

## Architecture

This library defines two protocols:

- MDMPlan
- MDMPerforming

and provides two object implementations:

- MDMTransaction
- MDMScheduler

### Life of a plan: Objective-C

The first step to describing motion declaratively is to define your plans.

Let's say we want to describe a view as "draggable".

#### Step 1: Define the plan

First, we create a new file pair called Draggable.h/m.

In Draggable.h:

    @import MaterialMotionRuntime;

    @interface Draggable : NSObject <MDMPlan>
    @end

In Draggable.m:

    @implementation Draggable
    @end

#### Step 2: Define the performer

We now define the performer object that will fulfill our Draggable plan.

We map the plan to the performer by implementing the `performerClass` method on the plan.

In Draggable.m:

    @interface DraggablePerformer : NSObject <MDMPerforming>
    @end

    @implementation Draggable

    - (Class)performerClass {
      return [DraggablePerformer class];
    }

    @end

    @implementation DraggablePerformer
    @end

#### Step 3: Implement the performer

We start by implementing the required `initWithTarget:` initializer from MDMPerforming. In this
initializer we register a pan gesture recognizer with the view.

> In practice we'll usually want to provide the gesture recognizer to the performer via the plan.
> This allows the creator of the plan to also pick which view the gesture recognizer is attached to.

In Draggable.m:

    @implementation DraggablePerformer

    - (instancetype)initWithTarget:(UIView *)target {
      self = [super init];
      if (self) {
        UIPanGestureRecognizer *pan = [UIPanGestureRecognizer new];
        [pan addTarget:self action:@selector(gestureDidChange:)];
        [target addGestureRecognizer:pan];
      }
      return self;
    }

    @end

We also implement the `gestureDidChange:` method. This method will be called whenever the user
interacts with the target view.

Note: The implementation shown belowÂ is only one of many ways such a performer could be implemented.

In Draggable.m:

    @interface DraggablePerformer ()
    @property(nonatomic) CGPoint initialGestureLocation;
    @property(nonatomic) CGPoint initialTargetPosition;
    @end

    - (void)gestureDidChange:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gesture {
      switch (gesture.state) {
        case UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan:
          self.initialGestureLocation = [gesture locationInView:gesture.view.superview];
          self.initialTargetPosition = gesture.view.layer.position;
          break;

        case UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged: {
          CGPoint currentLocation = [gesture locationInView:gesture.view.superview];
          CGVector delta = CGVectorMake(currentLocation.x - self.initialGestureLocation.x,
                                        currentLocation.y - self.initialGestureLocation.y);
          CGPoint newPosition = CGPointMake(self.initialTargetPosition.x + delta.dx,
                                            self.initialTargetPosition.y + delta.dy);
          gesture.view.layer.position = newPosition;
          break;
        }

        default:
          break;
      }
    }

#### Step 4: Associate plans with views

Create and retain a reference to a scheduler, likely in your view controller:

    self.scheduler = [MDMScheduler new];

Create a transaction. Plans are added to transactions. Transactions are committed to schedulers.

    MDMTransaction *transaction = [MDMTransaction new];
    [transaction addPlan:[Draggable new] toTarget:view];

Commit the transaction to the scheduler.

    [self.scheduler commitTransaction:transaction];

#### Step 5: Test it!

You can now drag your view around.

## Next steps

- Create your own family of plans/performers.
